### FIRP

high-level overview of a PowerShell framework that can be used to analyze security, PowerShell, Sysmon logs, and other incident response artifacts:


- Analyze data: After the data is normalized, it can be analyzed to detect security events and anomalies. PowerShell can be used to automate the analysis process and generate reports that highlight potential security issues.

- Normalize data: Once the data is collected, the next step is to normalize the data. This involves cleaning and formatting the data in a consistent manner so that it can be easily analyzed.

- Correlate data: Correlation involves linking events and data from different sources to identify patterns and relationships. PowerShell can be used to correlate data and help identify security incidents.

- Take action: Based on the analysis and visualization, appropriate action can be taken to remediate security incidents.

Overall, this framework can be used to automate many of the incident response tasks, making the process faster and more efficient. However, it's important to note that this is just a high-level overview and the actual implementation of such a framework may involve many more steps and considerations depending on the specific requirements of the organization.
